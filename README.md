# Welcome

I'm a **Product Owner** with a passion for building innovative solutions.

With a background in **Robotics and Automation (Ph.D.)**, I thrive at the intersection of technology, strategy, and user experience. Working with international teams across Jakarta and Paris, I bring a global perspective and a structured, analytical approach to problem-solving.

Beyond my work, I’m a creative thinker and an explorer. Whether it’s filmmaking, painting, crafting, or dancing salsa, I love blending logic with creativity. As a Paris Marathon finisher and a competitive sports enthusiast, I approach challenges with determination and adaptability.

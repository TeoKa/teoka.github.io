# SPORTS

Sports have always been a big part of my life, shaping my mindset both personally and professionally. I thrive on discipline, perseverance, and strategy—whether I’m on the field, the court, or the track.

## Runner
- Completed the Paris Marathon 2021, proving my endurance, commitment, and ability to push through challenges.
- Running with KIIN Paris: As part of this vibrant running community, I push my limits while connecting with like-minded athletes. Running isn’t just about speed—it’s about consistency, resilience, and self-improvement.

## Soccer Enthusiast
A lifelong passion that taught me teamwork, quick decision-making, and adaptability.

## Tennis Player
A mix of strategy and precision, much like the problem-solving approach I bring to work.

Because agility isn’t just for sports—it's also about rhythm, adaptability, and connecting with people.

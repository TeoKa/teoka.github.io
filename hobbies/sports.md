# Sports & Challenges

Sports have always been a big part of my life, shaping my mindset both personally and professionally. I thrive on discipline, perseverance, and strategy—whether I’m on the field, the court, or the track.

## Runner
**Completed the Paris Marathon (2021) with friends and Paris-Versailles (2024) with my colleagues**, proving my endurance, commitment, and ability to push through challenges. **Running with KIIN Paris**: As part of this vibrant running community, I push my limits while connecting with like-minded athletes. Running isn’t just about speed—it’s about consistency, resilience, and self-improvement.

## Soccer Enthusiast
A **lifelong passion** that taught me teamwork, quick decision-making, and adaptability. Not only with friends but also with colleagues! (*You cannot do a good Job is Job is the only thing you do*). Played tournaments of soccer (9 years).

## Tennis Player
A mix of **strategy and precision**, much like the problem-solving approach I bring to work. Played tournaments of soccer tennis (6 years).

## Salsa Dancer
Because agility isn’t just for sports—it's also about rhythm, **adaptability, and connecting with people**.

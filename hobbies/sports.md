# 🏅 SPORTS & CHALLENGES
Sport has been more than a hobby—it's been a way to grow discipline, resilience, and strategic thinking that I apply in every area of life, including product development and entrepreneurship.

## 🏃‍♂️ Runner
- **Paris Marathon 2021** – ran with friends, proving endurance and commitment.
- **Paris-Versailles 2024** – ran with colleagues, showing team spirit beyond the office.
- **Member of KIIN Paris** – an international running crew that combines athletic goals with a social edge. For me, running is not just a sport—it’s a way to stay grounded, focused, and inspired.

## ⚽ Soccer Enthusiast
Nine years of playing team tournaments taught me the fundamentals of collaboration, decision-making under pressure, and adaptability. Whether on a pitch or in a project meeting, those lessons stick. And yes—I still play with friends and colleagues because balance is key: "You can’t do a good job if your job is all you do."

## 🎾 Tennis Player
Precision and strategy define tennis—and my approach to problem-solving. I competed in doubles and soccer-tennis tournaments for over six years, honing my analytical side on the court.

## 💃 Salsa Dancer
Salsa taught me rhythm, fluidity, and connection. Dance is more than fun—it’s another form of communication and adaptability, both in personal and team dynamics.

## 🎨 More About Me
- Passionate about painting, filmmaking, and crafting.
- Exploring computer graphics as a creative outlet.
- Regularly reconnect with my roots in Tuscany, where my family—and my dog Bracco—await.

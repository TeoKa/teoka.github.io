I joined a start-up back in 2014 that was composed by only 3 people, I was the third person. This was my first impact with entepreneurs and it felt great. The challenges, the failures, the success, the vibe of this type of environment is incredible. It is a unique feeling. It was a time where I had several roles at the same time, I did not realize back then, but now that I work in a company is really clear. There was always very much to do, to think, everyday in order to _survive_ and _innovate_ to sell start-up products to new clients. I remember that sometimes the week days were not enough and weekends were needed to finish work.

# Entrepreneurship

## perClass

I joined a start-up üéØ back in 2014 that was composed by only 3 people, I was the third person. This was my first impact with entepreneurs and it felt great. The challenges, the failures, the success, the vibe of this type of environment is incredible. It is a unique feeling. It was a time where I had several roles at the same time, I did not realize back then, but now that I work in a company is really clear. There was always very much to do, to think, everyday in order to _survive_ and _innovate_ to sell start-up products to new clients. I remember that sometimes the week days were not enough and weekends were needed to finish work ([More Info](https://teoka.github.io/career/work.html)). 

## Jeerasta

Back in 2014, my roommate and I were very motivated to open a small business operation called [Jeerasta](https://www.youtube.com/@jeerasta5220). We were (and still are) great chef üßëüèª‚Äçüç≥ in our little. And we wanted to experiment what would happen if we not only cook for ourselves but also for Dutch neighbors. No questions behind the fact that food culture is not in Dutch culture. On the other hands, we were one Italian üçï and one Indian/Canadian ü´ñ that could cook very well. So we tried: we start selling food to our neighbors. It was a success!! People called us back even for Christmas to cook for their Christams lunch üéÑ. I cannot express how, back in those days, that experience was truly exceptional. Those were the years when [Just Eat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_Eat) (food delivery service) floated on the London Stock Exchange. So, we were really inspired. We were proud of our little experiment but it did not last long since we took different roads. I went back to Italy for my first ever internship and my roommate, [Abhishek](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhisheksen/) took a real entepreneural path and today he is CEO of his own company [NumberEight](https://www.linkedin.com/company/numbereight/).



## BOXALMATCH

**Boxalmatch** is a collective entertainment initiative I co-founded with a group of long-time friends. Initially started in 2019 as a casual gaming group, it has since evolved into a structured project organizing both online and in-person events, including gaming tournaments, creative challenges, and community-driven experiences.  

Our goal is to foster engagement through interactive entertainment, leveraging digital platforms and social experiences. To support this vision, we are building an organized structure to manage content, events, and potential collaborations. This project allows me to apply and refine my skills in **product management, community engagement, and digital strategy**, all while ensuring that the business aspect never interferes with the strong friendships at its core.

This project can be found on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@BOXALMATCH) and on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/boxalmatch/).

I joined a start-up back in 2014 that was composed by only 3 people, I was the third person. This was my first impact with entepreneurs and it felt great. The challenges, the failures, the success, the vibe of this type of environment is incredible. It is a unique feeling. It was a time where I had several roles at the same time, I did not realize back then, but now that I work in a company is really clear. There was always very much to do, to think, everyday in order to _survive_ and _innovate_ to sell start-up products to new clients. I remember that sometimes the week days were not enough and weekends were needed to finish work.

## BOXALMATCH

**Boxalmatch** is a collective entertainment initiative I co-founded with a group of long-time friends. Initially started in 2019 as a casual gaming group, it has since evolved into a structured project organizing both online and in-person events, including gaming tournaments, creative challenges, and community-driven experiences.  

Our goal is to foster engagement through interactive entertainment, leveraging digital platforms and social experiences. To support this vision, we are building an organized structure to manage content, events, and potential collaborations. This project allows me to apply and refine my skills in **product management, community engagement, and digital strategy**, all while ensuring that the business aspect never interferes with the strong friendships at its core.

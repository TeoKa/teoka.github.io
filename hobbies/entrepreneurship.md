# ðŸš€ ENTREPRENEURSHIP

## perClass â€“ My First Startup Dive
In 2014, I joined perClass, a cutting-edge startup in hyperspectral imaging, as employee #3. It was my first taste of entrepreneurship, and the impact was profound. In that intense, fast-paced environment, I wore multiple hatsâ€”from engineering and product development to client demos and sales support. I didnâ€™t even realize I was juggling so many roles until I joined a larger company later on. Startup life was raw and demandingâ€”sometimes weekends were the only way to keep upâ€”but the energy, creativity, and urgency to innovate were unforgettable.

## Jeerasta â€“ Culinary Meets Community
That same year, my roommate and I launched [Jeerasta](https://www.youtube.com/@jeerasta5220), a neighborhood food venture in the Netherlands. An Indian-Canadian and an Italian (me!) decided to share our culinary roots with our Dutch neighborsâ€”and they loved it. We cooked, delivered, and even catered holiday meals. Our passion turned into a small, heartwarming success story just as platforms like [Just Eat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_Eat) were making waves in food delivery. Though short-livedâ€”my internship and his startup dreams took us elsewhereâ€”it sparked a fire. Today, [Abhishek](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhisheksen/) is the CEO of his own [company](https://www.linkedin.com/company/numbereight/). And Iâ€™m still proud of our bold experiment.

## Boxalmatch â€“ Friendship, Fun & Digital Experiences
Boxalmatch began in 2019 as a casual gaming group among childhood friends and has grown into a creative collective for digital and in-person entertainment. We now organize tournaments, challenges, and community events that blend fun with friendship. As a co-founder, I focus on structure, content, and product visionâ€”ensuring we stay playful and professional without compromising the friendship that started it all.

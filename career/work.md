## IDEMIA

### Common Personalization System ([CPS](https://www.idemia.com/card-personalization-services))

I am Product Owner of CPS. It is a proprietary software used in worldwide IDEMIA factories to industrialize products. Specifically in the industrialization, CPS is used to install software in chip cards, part of cards personalization process.


### Winner of IDEMIA Innovathon ([Post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/matteociocca_sustainability-innovation-daring-activity-6909524647956914176-79p2?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAABN7odwBCTSkSQQbgUbxRNshm2Aiwhhjvqs))

It was a great opportunity that started by joining a weekly innovation brainstorming session. I had absolutely no background on payment systems and technology. But I got involved actively into this weekly until I was able to draft together with few folks a single page paper about a suistainable idea based on circular economy model. This was only 4 months after I joinied IDEMIA. And, just after completing the MAS Global CBDC Challenge hackathon, I put together a team that coupled 2 Business Units. This team, based on this idea called PARISMA, won the IDEMIA Innovathon in 2022. I personally presented PARISMA to the CEO and the Executive Board of IDEMIA.

Revealed during the 2021 MAS Global CBDC Challenge hackathon, this solution paves the way for the future of money by allowing everyone to use digital cash, anywhere and anytime.  

This was my first time as Project Manager of a +25 team that spread across 2 continent and on more than 3 site. It was an incredible experience and I learnt a lot from it. My learning curve skyrocket during this period of time and it was clear to me that I wanted a more management career, I truly believed and still believe that is the right fit for me.


## INRIA

### Safe MPC-based Control for Self-Driving Transit Bus

## IIT

### Walking on Uneven Terrain

I was co-author of a work on optimal impedances for completing a safe and stable foothold in uneven terrain ([Article](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7803270)).

### Joint Torque Estimation

My work focus on the Estimataion of Joint Torque at Knee Level of Humanoid Robot iCub. Moreover, 

## perClass

Back in 2014, I was looking for experience and passion for technology (I did not even graduate it yet, and intership were not mandatory). I found opportunity in a start-up called [perClass](https://www.perclass.com/) for 3 months. This was a truly remarakble experience. I worked with Pattern Recognition algorithms. Algorithms that are known today in the field of Machine Learning. I participated to many tradefair with perClass meeting clients and understanding their needs. Truly fantastic.

### Gender Classifier

The image acquisition and face detection are performed by OpenCV. perClass then classifies each face region as male or female. The application can run in a laptop with an embedded camera. Furthermore the application was showed at the Vision trade fair in Stuttgart using an industrial computer (Advantech) with Matrix-Vision industrial mvBlueCOUGAR-X102eC camera.

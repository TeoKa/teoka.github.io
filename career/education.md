### My Work Abstract

This work focuses on two challenging tasks for humanoid robots: bipedal balance and collision
avoidance in a dense crowd. We solve these tasks on a limited time horizon in which we can
anticipate the consequences of robot actions.
We can guarantee that the robot is able to stop in a few steps and avoid falling. When
the robot is not planning to stop but to continue walking, we show the guarantee to avoid
falling is not lost but it depends on the length of the time horizon. It is impossible to know
beforehand what people will do next, so we cannot guarantee that no collision will ever occur ([Article](https://inria.hal.science/hal-01618881/file/ICHR17_0017_FI.pdf)).  

Over a limited time horizon we can guarantee Passive Safety: the robot is able to stop before
a collision occurs. This safety guarantee is combined with fall avoidance in a Model Predictive
Control scheme. The capacity for the robot to react and avoid collisions is constrained once
a step is planted on the ground, until the next step is initiated. With the control scheme
outlined above the robot reacts not only at each step initiation but also in between. We
show that reacting only once per step (thus saving computational power) does not degrade
collision avoidance capability ([Article](https://inria.hal.science/hal-02267426/document)).  

The time left for people to react and avoid collisions once the robot has stopped (to
guarantee Passive Safety) might not be enough. We propose a new control scheme called
Collision Mitigation that guarantees fall avoidance while aiming to leave as much time as
possible for the people to react. As a result, the robot collides less often and later than when
it guarantees Passive Safety ([Article](https://inria.hal.science/hal-04200354/file/2023_IROS_Ciocca_et_al_.pdf)).  

This scheme can be adapted to take different priorities into account. For example, when the members of a crowd are divided in robots and people, the robot should leave as much time as possible for the people to react and then, if possible, for the other robots. Or when the robot must reach a target location at the utmost important and people might obstruct the motion of the robot, the robot can jostle people if necessary
to reach the location.

### Model Prediction ([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTrsH-3jjGE))

Task: _Given a set of 9568 hourly average ambient environmental readings from sensors of a Combined Cycle Power Plant (CCPP), build a model to predict the electrical energy output of the CCPP, which uses a combination of gas turbines, steam turbines, and heat recovery steam generators to generate power._

## Virtual Assistant for Violence Prevention ([Part.1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRpccKmPCUQ)) ([Part.2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZzr4xP3w8E))

Task: _Choose a project topic and then work through a series of steps to evaluate the opportunity, walk through the Business Understanding phase of the CRISP-DM process for it, develop a validation plan for the solution, consider key Machine Learning system design decisions, and identify potential issues that may affect the final model in production._


## Master Courses Assistant

During my Master of Science (Delft), I was hired part-time as course assistant during my master thesis. I was able to finally sit _on the other side of the table_ and understand the problems from professor perspective. This experience helped me to take the first steps as a coach to help colleague and co-worker struggling with difficul problems. But also this experience helped me to improve as a good listener. Back in 2015, I decided to give few lectures on one of the most powerful academic tool: LaTeX ([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pDUcLjUMNo)).

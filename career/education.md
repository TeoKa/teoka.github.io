Task: _Choose a project topic and then work through a series of steps to evaluate the opportunity, walk through the Business Understanding phase of the CRISP-DM process for it, develop a validation plan for the solution, consider key Machine Learning system design decisions, and identify potential issues that may affect the final model in production._


## Master Courses Assistant

During my Master of Science (Delft), I was hired part-time as course assistant during my master thesis. I was able to finally sit _on the other side of the table_ and understand the problems from professor perspective. This experience helped me to take the first steps as a coach to help colleague and co-worker struggling with difficul problems. But also this experience helped me to improve as a good listener. Back in 2015, I decided to give few lectures on one of the most powerful academic tool: LaTeX ([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pDUcLjUMNo)).
